## EscapeRoom

Java-based grid escape challenge where you navigate a player sprite across a trapped board, gather hidden prizes, and reach the far-right edge in as few steps as possible. Movement can be driven through the console or directly from the game window via keyboard shortcuts.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Objective**: Cross from the starting cell on the left to the far-right boundary while collecting prizes and avoiding hidden traps and walls.
- **Board**: 8×5 grid rendered via `GameGUI`, with random walls, traps, and coin prizes generated each round.
- **Score**: Begins at `0`. Every action that interacts with the board adjusts the score immediately; results are echoed after each command.
- **Steps**: Every attempted move increments the step counter, even when blocked. Finishing efficiently improves post-game feedback.

## Commands and Controls

- **Movement**: `right/r`, `left/l`, `up/u`, `down/d` move one cell (60 px). Hitting a wall or moving off-grid costs 5 points.
- **Jumping**: `jump/jr`, `jumpleft/jl`, `jumpup/ju`, `jumpdown/jd` move two cells in the indicated direction. Jumping obeys the same collision, trap, and prize rules as walking.
- **Prize Pickup**: `pickup/p` collects a coin if one exists on your current tile (+10). Empty tiles cause a -10 penalty.
- **Replay**: `replay` resets the entire board, reactivates traps/prizes, and returns the player to the start. If called before reaching the far-right wall you incur a 10-point penalty; otherwise you earn 10 points for a successful run and can hand the board to another player.
- **Quit**: `quit/q` closes the GUI and exits the main loop. `endGame()` automatically scores +10 for finishing on the far-right wall, or -10 if you quit early.
- **Help**: `help` or `?` prints the full command reminder.
- **Invalid Input Handling**: The prompt remains until the player supplies one of the recognized commands; the helper text clarifies expectations before you try again.
- **GUI Shortcuts**: With the game window focused you can use arrow keys for movement, `Shift`+arrow for jumps, `P` to pick up prizes, `R` to replay, and `Q` to quit. GUI input routes through the same scoring logic as console commands.

## Scoring System

- **Prizes**: +10 per pickup.
- **Traps**: +5 for successfully springing one, -5 when you try to spring a cleared location.
- **Walls**: -5 when moving into a wall segment.
- **Off-grid Move**: -5 when leaving the board boundaries.
- **Replay Before Finish**: -10; after finish +10.
- **Quit Before Finish**: -10 via `endGame()`. Reaching the far-right wall yields +10.

## Gameplay Loop

1. `EscapeRoom` prints the welcome banner, keyboard hints, and initializes `GameGUI`.
2. `GameGUI.createBoard()` scatters walls, traps, and prizes to random cells.
3. The console prompt accepts commands validated by `UserInput.getValidInput()`. Only allowed commands continue the loop.
4. Each valid command updates score and steps, then prints the new totals.
5. The loop continues until the player chooses `quit/q`; `endGame()` applies the final completion or early-exit adjustment and closes the window.

## Build and Run

Prerequisites: Java 8+ JDK on macOS, Windows, or Linux. A mouse/keyboard is required to interact with the GUI window.

Compile:
```
javac EscapeRoom.java GameGUI.java UserInput.java
```

Run:
```
java EscapeRoom
```

The GUI opens immediately. Keep the console visible to issue text commands or view score updates generated by GUI actions.

## Repository Layout

- `EscapeRoom.java`: Main loop, command dispatch, score aggregation, and command prompt logic.
- `GameGUI.java`: Swing component responsible for rendering the grid, player sprite, walls, traps, prizes, and handling keyboard shortcuts.
- `UserInput.java`: Utility for validating console commands against the authorized list.
- `*.png`: Sprite assets for the board background, player, prizes, and obstacles; can be swapped with custom artwork of the same dimensions.
- `*.class`: Precompiled artifacts; regenerate them with `javac` if you modify any source files.

## Customization Tips

- Update the PNG assets (same filenames) to reskin the grid, walls, or player.
- Adjust `totalWalls`, `totalPrizes`, and `totalTraps` in `GameGUI` to tune difficulty before calling `createBoard()`.
- Modify `prizeVal`, `trapVal`, `endVal`, `offGridVal`, or `hitWallVal` to rebalance scoring.
- Extend the list of valid commands in `EscapeRoom` if you add new actions; route them through `GameGUI` for consistent scoring.

Playtest by combining console commands with GUI controls to understand trap placement and efficiently reach the exit with a high score.
